## üìå Project Status

This repository currently contains **pseudo-code and high-level implementation sketches** illustrating the core methodology of the paper.

üöß **Important Notice**

- **Some parts of the code are not yet executable in a one-click manner** and are still under refactoring and debugging.  
- **The models we trained locally have been uploaded to Hugging FaceÔºö**

  &nbsp;
  <a href="https://huggingface.co/caiyuchen">https://huggingface.co/caiyuchen</a>
  </span> for direct inference and evaluation.  

- Therefore, **full reproduction of all experimental results is still under development**, but we are actively working on completing the implementation.

## ‚úÖ Upcoming Updates

- Complete training pipeline with configurable hyperparameters  
- Reproducible experiment scripts  
- Visualization toolkit for analyzing RL dynamics  
- Additional pre-trained checkpoints for easier evaluation

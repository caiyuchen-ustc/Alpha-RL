# On Predictability of Reinforcement Learning Dynamics for Large Language Models

This repository corresponds to the paper:

> **On Predictability of Reinforcement Learning Dynamics for Large Language Models**  
> *https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00553*

## üìå Project Status

This repository currently contains **pseudo-code and high-level implementation sketches** illustrating the core methodology of the paper.

üöß **Important Notice**

- **Some parts of the code are not yet executable in a one-click manner** and are still under refactoring and debugging.
- **The trained models used in the experiments have not yet been uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub**. Links will be provided once they are available.
- Therefore, **full reproduction of the experimental results is not yet supported**, but we are actively working on completing the implementation.

## ‚úÖ Upcoming Updates

- Complete training pipeline with configurable hyperparameters  
- Upload of trained models to Hugging Face for direct inference and evaluation  
- Reproducible experiment scripts  
- Visualization toolkit for analyzing RL dynamics
